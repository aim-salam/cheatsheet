## 🤝 Collaboration

1. **Issues**:

   - You can see all the issues that need to be fixed in the [Issues section](https://github.com/aim-salam/cheatsheet/issues).
   - To take an issue, comment using this format:

2. **Pull request**:

   - Make sure you have your own repository on GitHub by clicking **Fork**.
   - Create a new branch in your local repository.
     ```bash
      git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
     ```
   - After making changes, commit them to the new branch.
   - Then push.
   - If your remote repository doesn’t have the current branch, create a new one.
     ```bash
      git push origin feature/my-new-feature
     ```    
   - Create a pull request to merge your changes into the production code.
   - Your pull request will be visible on this [site](https://github.com/aim-salam/cheatsheet/pulls). Please wait for my response. I will either approve your code and merge it into production, or provide feedback if changes are needed.

3. **More contributions**:

   - Synchronize your main remote repository with the production remote main repository by clicking **Sync fork**.
   - In your local repository, switch to main branch. Then, update to the latest codebase to stay up to date with new changes.

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

   - Create a new branch for each issue and repeat step 2.
