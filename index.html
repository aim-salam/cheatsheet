    <h1>Example of HTML Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first paragraph of text. It is used to demonstrate how
      paragraphs work in HTML. The text will be displayed with space above and
      below it, separating it from other content.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the second paragraph. Each paragraph starts on a new line and
      extends to the full width of the container. Paragraphs are usually used to
      break up text into readable chunks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional paragraphs can be added in the same way. HTML will
      automatically add space between paragraphs to make the content easier to
      read and understand.
